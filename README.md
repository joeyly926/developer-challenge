# Vaccine Passport DApp

Healthcare portal and backend for adding and viewing patients with respect to vaccinations. In the UI, users (healthcare professionals for now) may add patients, add vaccination documentation for each patient. With each addition of a vaccination dose, the Smart Contract determines if the user is fully vaccinated based on guidelines set by each vaccine manufacturer.
